# UNSW-NB15 Dataset

The **UNSW-NB15** source files (**pcap files**, **BRO files**, **Argus files**, **CSV files**, and **reports**) can be downloaded from **[HERE](https://research.unsw.edu.au/projects/unsw-nb15-dataset)**.  
You can also use our new datasets created in the **TON_IoT** project.

## Dataset Description

The raw network packets of the **UNSW-NB15 dataset** were created by the **IXIA PerfectStorm** tool in the **Cyber Range Lab** of **UNSW Canberra**.  
This setup generated a hybrid of real modern normal activities and synthetic contemporary attack behaviours.  
The `tcpdump` tool was used to capture **100 GB** of raw traffic (i.e., Pcap files).

This dataset includes **nine types of attacks**:

- Fuzzers  
- Analysis  
- Backdoors  
- DoS  
- Exploits  
- Generic  
- Reconnaissance  
- Shellcode  
- Worms  

The **Argus** and **Bro-IDS** tools were used, and **twelve algorithms** were developed to generate **49 features** (plus the class label).  
These features are described in the `UNSW-NB15_features.csv` file.

## Dataset Files

- Total records: **2,540,044**
- Stored in four CSV files:
  - `UNSW-NB15_1.csv`
  - `UNSW-NB15_2.csv`
  - `UNSW-NB15_3.csv`
  - `UNSW-NB15_4.csv`
- Ground truth table: `UNSW-NB15_GT.csv`
- Event list file: `UNSW-NB15_LIST_EVENTS.csv`

A partition of this dataset is configured as:

- **Training set:** `UNSW_NB15_training-set.csv` (175,341 records)
- **Testing set:** `UNSW_NB15_testing-set.csv` (82,332 records)

Both contain records from different attack and normal categories.
